# Mad Libs Game
This Python program is a simple Mad Libs game where the user provides specific words, which are then inserted into a fun story template. The user will be prompted to provide:

A large object
Large objects (plural)
An adjective
A body part
A restaurant
Two types of food
The program then uses these inputs to generate a story with the provided words. It greets the user, prompts for the necessary inputs, and displays the completed story at the end.


# PowerBall Number Generator
This Python program generates random numbers for a PowerBall ticket. The user will receive:

Five random numbers between 1 and 69 (representing the white balls).
One random number between 1 and 26 (representing the red PowerBall).
The numbers are displayed with one space between the first five white balls and three spaces between the last white ball and the red PowerBall. The program includes a greeting when it starts and a farewell message upon completion.
