The numbers are displayed with appropriate formatting, and the program includes both a greeting and farewell message.

# Friday Project 3 - Number Guessing Game
A number guessing game where the computer selects a random number between 1 and 10. The user guesses the number:

The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
