A large object
Large objects (plural)
An adjective
A body part
A restaurant
Two types of food
The program then uses these inputs to generate a story with the provided words. It greets the user, prompts for the necessary inputs, and displays the completed story at the end.


# PowerBall Number Generator
This Python program generates random numbers for a PowerBall ticket. The user will receive:

Five random numbers between 1 and 69 (representing the white balls).
One random number between 1 and 26 (representing the red PowerBall).
The numbers are displayed with one space between the first five white balls and three spaces between the last white ball and the red PowerBall. The program includes a greeting when it starts and a farewell message upon completion.

# Number Guessing Game 
This Python program is a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 10, and the user tries to guess it.

The user is greeted and asked if they want to play the game.
If the user chooses to play, they will be prompted to guess the number.
If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed.
If the guess is incorrect, the user is asked to try again.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
After the game, a farewell message is displayed.
The program uses a random number generator and a loop to provide continuous guessing until the correct answer is guessed.

# Trivia Quiz Program
This Python program is a simple trivia quiz that allows users to test their knowledge with a set of predefined questions.

The quiz consists of at least five trivia questions stored in a dictionary, where keys are the questions and values are the correct answers.
Users are prompted to answer each question one at a time.
After each answer, the program provides feedback on whether the user's response is correct or incorrect.
At the end of the quiz, the program tallies the user's score and displays the total number of correct answers out of the total questions asked.
The program is designed to be straightforward and interactive, making it a fun way to learn and review trivia.
