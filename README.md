A large object
Large objects (plural)
An adjective
A body part

Two types of food

# PowerBall Number Generator
This Python program generates random numbers for a PowerBall ticket. The user will receive:

Five random numbers between 1 and 69 (representing the white balls).
One random number between 1 and 26 (representing the red PowerBall).
The numbers are displayed with one space between the first five white balls and three spaces between the last white ball and the red PowerBall. The program includes a greeting when it starts and a farewell message upon completion.

Number Guessing Game - README
This Python program is a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a secret number between 1 and 10, and the user tries to guess it.

The user is greeted and asked if they want to play the game.
If the user chooses to play, they will be prompted to guess the number.
If the guess is correct, a congratulatory message is displayed.
If the guess is incorrect, the user is asked to try again.
The game continues until the user guesses the correct number.
After the game, a farewell message is displayed.
The program uses a random number generator and a loop to provide continuous guessing until the correct answer is guessed.
